# Neuroscience-Article-Database

# Project Overview

## NeuroLog

[NeuroLog Website](URL)

## Project Description

NeuroLog is a react build which shows users a database of neuroscience-related research articles. Users will be able to view current research, add new articles, and delete them. As a PMVP I will add a second Airtable with a popular news geared towards less science-iclined users and possibly an external API with a larger databse of journal articles.

#### MVP 

- Home page with navigation bar to article list and add an article pages.
- Get and render articles from Airtable.
- Use forms to add articles and update Airtable.
- Delete articles from the Airtable.


#### PostMVP  

- Add second Airtable with news
- Add external API with large database of journal articles
- Make it look really good

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I have a good understanding of react apps and components. I also have several similar builds from labs that I can review.

### Weaknesses: I sometimes have trouble with mapping through the APIs. 

### Opportunities: I am excited to show off my skill in building react apps, using Airtable, and designing a great looking app.

### Threats: I'll sometimes get stuck spending too much time on CSS styling. Or get stuck on something not functioning and then come back later to realize it was just a tiny typo.
