# Neuroscience-Article-Database

# Project Overview

## NeuroLog

[NeuroLog Website](URL)

## Project Description

NeuroLog is a react build which shows users a database of neuroscience-related research articles. Users will be able to view current research, add new articles, and delete them. As a PMVP I will add a second Airtable with a popular news geared towards less science-iclined users and possibly an external API with a larger databse of journal articles.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Liz Yrineo",
                "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
                "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",
                "setup": "What did the green grape say to the red grape?",
                "punchline": "Breathe, idiot, breathe!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Gary Grant",
                "setup": "How do you make holy water?",
                "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

-Home page with navigation bar to article list and add an article pages.
-Get and render articles from Airtable.
-Use forms to add articles and update Airtable.
-Delete articles from the Airtable.


#### PostMVP  

- Add second Airtable with news
- Add external API with large database of journal articles
- Make it look really good
